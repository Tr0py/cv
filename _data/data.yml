      I am a Research Assistant at Nankai University, before this, I obtained my Bachelor degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nankai University](http://en.nankai.edu.cn/) in 2020. 
      I am actively envolved in research projects, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoli Gong](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2019/0619/c13620a179396/page.htm), also with guidances from
      Prof. [Pen-Chung Yew](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~yew/)
      and Prof. [Wenwen Wang](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~wenwen/).
      I'm enjoying the research and looking for a Ph.D. position now. [\[CV here\]](./assets/materials/ziyi-resume-2020-12-v6.pdf) [\[Google Scholar\]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bVSQ0Y4AAAAJ)

      **Research Interests**  
      My research interests include Operating System and Network, Distributed Systems, Large Scale Computing/Storage Systems, Parallel Processing, Computer Architectures and Security. 

      Current areas of focus include Cross-ISA Virtualization, Dynamic Binary Translation, JIT Security. I am also interested in design issues in system interacting with Non-volatile Memory and RDMA.
